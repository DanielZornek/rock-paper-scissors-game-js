## How it works?

- In my version there are 5 rounds, sIf in the 5th round there is a tie between the player and the Robo, there will be a new round to break the tie, when reaching the last round it is impossible to play, because the options (rock, paper and scissors disappear), the player must click on restart to play again;

- All the sprites in the game was made by me :).
